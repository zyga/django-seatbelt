Fasten your seatbelts
=====================

Look ma' no junk from ``/usr/local`` in the way!:

    >>> from django_seatbelt import seatbelt
    >>> with seatbelt.fasten():
    >>>     import something

For extra security while in the air please keep the seatbelt fastened for good.
Perfect for your packaged Django application. Lower support costs from users
and isolate your tested code from (typically) junk-ridden /usr/local.

    >>> from django_seatbelt import seatbelt
    >>> seatbelt.solder()
    >>> import django.core.handlers.wsgi
    >>> application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
